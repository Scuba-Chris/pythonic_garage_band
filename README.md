To create this application there needs to be several classes created. A class for the Band, Musician, and one for each of the different insturments.

## Architecture
This application is command line based. It is written in Python. The application uses a super class, along it a couple ofter classes with the respective methods to create new bands instances. Each band instance can be given members.

## API
- Bands 
    - all_bands - list of all bands created

    - to_list - returns the list of band instances

- Muscicians
    - init attributes

        - insturment
